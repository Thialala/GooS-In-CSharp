# GooS-In-CSharp
The aim is to provide a full implementation of the example in .Net C# from the book [Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/index.html).

I'll try to implement it as close to the one given in book using the suitable tools available in .Net.

I decided to put each chapter in its own solution to track changes and evolution made on each iteration.

Go the [wiki](https://github.com/Thialala/GooS-In-CSharp/wiki) to start.

Feel free to tweet or send me a mail if you have any questions.
